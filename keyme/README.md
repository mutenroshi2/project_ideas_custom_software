KEY DETECTOR v1.0

Created a sample project to detect keys(reflected/metal surfaces) on a live video stream


Software also allows the user to load previously saved images for region detection


Specific path and name can be given to the images or default name and path will be assigned


Key outline appears at the center of the video streaming - To help users align the key 


Attach a key on a white piece of paper and align the key to the outline projected in the video


Have attached few test images - test7.jpg is actual image captured from a phone , rest of the images are downloaded from the internet


---------------DEVELOPMENT/IMPROVEMENTS PLANNED------------------

Better object detection algorithm needed - Right now many false positives are being detected(Eg:Paper,light source etc)


User Name and Exisiting user module created, currently being used as a placeholder, need to add code for that


To improve ROI algorithm


Use phone camera as an IP camera, since the webcam on the computer offers really low resolution
